# **App Name**: Layout Canvas

## Core Features:

- Draw Layout: Enable users to draw boxes on a canvas using drag-and-drop functionality, defining the layout structure.
- Detect Boxes: Track the position and dimensions of each drawn box within the canvas using JavaScript.
- Upload Image: Allow users to upload images from their device into any of the drawn boxes via a file input.
- Resize Image: Implement controls for scaling and repositioning the images within their respective boxes.
- Change Background: Provide a color picker interface that allows the user to select and change the background color of the canvas.
- AI Background Matcher: When image size is small, use a blur-edge or clone-fill method to subtly extend the image to fill the box. The tool will choose to use or omit an optional subtle shadow + gradient.
- Export to Image: Implement functionality to export the current state of the canvas, including layout and images, as a single PNG or JPG image.
